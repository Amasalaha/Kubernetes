Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, 
and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 
Kubernetes is designed to be highly scalable and resilient, making it an ideal platform for deploying and managing modern, cloud-native applications.

At the core of Kubernetes is the concept of a cluster, which consists of one or more nodes that run containerized applications. 
Each node runs a container runtime, such as Docker, and communicates with a Kubernetes control plane to coordinate the deployment and management of applications.

Kubernetes uses a declarative approach to application management, which means that you specify the desired state of the system, 
and Kubernetes takes care of making sure that the current state matches the desired state. This is achieved using Kubernetes objects, 
which are defined in YAML files and describe the desired state of the system.

Here's an example YAML file that defines a simple deployment in Kubernetes:
<pre class="code-block">
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
</pre>





This YAML file defines a deployment called nginx-deployment that specifies that three replicas of the nginx container should be running at all times. 
The selector field specifies how the replicas should be selected, and the template field specifies the details of the container specification.

Kubernetes also provides a web-based dashboard that makes it easy to monitor and manage your cluster. Here's a screenshot of the Kubernetes dashboard:

The dashboard provides an overview of your cluster and allows you to drill down into individual objects, such as deployments, pods, and services. 
You can also use the dashboard to perform common tasks, such as scaling up or down your deployments, updating your applications, and monitoring your cluster health.
